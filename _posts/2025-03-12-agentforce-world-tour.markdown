For anyone in the Salesforce industry, AgentForce represents the biggest leap forward since the introduction of the Lightning Experience. With AI at its core, this innovation has the potential to not only propel Salesforce itself but also revolutionize its customers' operations.

On December 18, 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the AgentForce World Tour in Atlanta. My primary goal for attending was to get an idea of the current capabilities of AgentForce and gain some insight into its future direction.

### Keynote Highlights

The keynote was undoubtedly a highlight of the event. It showcased a live, real-world application of AgentForce at Saks Fifth Avenue. The presentation walked us through the evolution of customer service. From traditional phone systems with endless menu options to chatbots that provide basic assistance.

Then came the reveal of AgentForce: an AI customer service agent capable of answering questions and taking actions—all without needing to transfer to a human agent in this case. This seamless integration of AI into customer interactions illustrated just how transformative AgentForce can be.

### Workshops and Sessions

One of the most engaging parts of the event was the opportunity to sit down and build a custom AI agent. The process was entirely declarative, making it accessible even to those without deep technical expertise. The user interface was intuitive, and the experience demonstrated how easy it can be to deploy Salesforce's AI solution.

Even more exciting was hearing about future enhancements, such as headless agents, the ability to package agents, and agent-to-agent communication. These developments promise to further streamline and expand the possibilities of AI in Salesforce.

Another session that stood out focused on AI innovations in Slack. These features are designed to boost internal productivity and, naturally, tie back to AgentForce capabilities. I’m particularly interested in the huddle notes feature that automatically summarizes a conversation. It was fascinating to see how deeply these tools integrate, creating a cohesive ecosystem that enhances both customer and employee experiences.

### Observations and Reflections

While I didn’t dedicate much time to networking—opting instead to immerse myself in the shiny new features—I walked away with a sense of optimism. AgentForce doesn’t feel like a threat to developer roles; if anything, it’s likely to create even more opportunities.

That said, the connection to Data Cloud underscores the importance of feeding these AI agents with comprehensive data, which can be a significant investment. And adoption of AI will likely remain challenging for organizations that haven’t yet maximized the potential of Salesforce’s standard automation tools. 

### Conclusion

The event itself was beautifully organized. From the forest-inspired Trailhead decor to the well-designed space and excellent food, it was clear that a lot of thought went into making this a memorable experience. For a single-day event, it packed an impressive amount of value.

I’m incredibly grateful to have been able to attend and to the individuals who brought this event to life. AgentForce is still in its early stages, but its potential is undeniable. I’m excited to see how it evolves and what new opportunities it will create for the Salesforce community.
